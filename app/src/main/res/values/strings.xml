    <string name="help_text_1">This is a two players game\n
        (or one against artificial intelligence).\n\n
        Each player is owner 2 sets of tokens. \n\n The Yellow and Red sets:

        The mission is to fall down all your tokens from the input queues via the wheels down to
        the output queue before the opponent does this with his tokens. \n\n

        In each turn a player select one wheel and rotate it as much as they want in one direction. Then press on the turn done button:

    <string name="help_text_4">
        After that the turn is over and the opponent can rotate any wheel, with one exception: they
        cannot rotate the same wheel that was rotated just now.\n\n

        The tokens of each color must fall to output queue in order. That means: token 1 before token 2 and so on.
        If players tokens fall to output queue out of order, they immediately lose the game.\n\n
